MutualAidNational;United States of America;US;Welcome to the COVID-19 Mutual Aid Coordination Slack.  recent weeks, new mutual aid networks have sprung up around the country. Other older networks have been re-activated, and still more have been around for a long time and never stopped being active. We haven’t seen any mechanism for these networks to communicate directly with one another, so we decided to build one. We know that we have a lot to learn from each other. Our goal is to bring our diverse networks into more effective coordination, for the duration of this crisis and beyond.The hope is that this workspace can be used to share resources, tools, and best practices, to resource, scale, and replicate mutual aid, and to otherwise communicate.;network|||collaboration|||technology|||help|||coordination;MutualAidNational>>>https://join.slack.com/t/mutualaidnational/shared_invite/zt-cs6npzra-1~A9RFuKusoN_cb~Bqy8Gg>>>SLACK
